; Write table overview
; Section 1: 1 byte containing the number of fields, and then field names as a string of 8-bit chars
; Field names are additionally prefaced with an integer containing an integer containing the length of the name
; Then it has the datatype enumeration for that field, and then an 8 bit representation of truthness of 
; 	- PRIMARY KEY
;	- UNIQUE 
;	- AUTO_INCREMENT
;	- NULL (NOT NULL :FALSE)

; Section 2: Number of indexes(1 byte) then field names as 8-bit chars, that is used as indexes. Default is id.
; These field-names are similarly prefaced with an integer containing the length of the name, but not the datatype

; STRUCTURE
; Num_fields(8-bit) field_length (8-bit) field_name (8-bit charseq)  field_datatype (8-bit) 
; Num_indexes (8-bit) field_length (8-bit) field_name (8-bit charseq)

; Arguments for table form "Table name as String" (list of (cons with field name and data-type)) (list of indexes)
