; Section 1: 1 byte containing the number of fields, and then field names as a string of 8-bit chars
; Field names are additionally prefaced with an integer containing an integer containing the length of the name
; Then it has the datatype enumeration for that field, and then an 8 bit representation of truthness of 
; 	- PRIMARY KEY
;	- UNIQUE 
;	- AUTO_INCREMENT
;	- NULL (NOT NULL :FALSE)

; Section 2: Number of indexes(1 byte) then field names as 8-bit chars, that is used as indexes. Default is id.
; These field-names are similarly prefaced with an integer containing the length of the name, but not the datatype

; Insert a row / write row
; Read the table overview, to accumulate the structure
; Open index file of table, for writing file-positions of rows in data files
; Open data files of table, for writing rows
; Index files contain sections representing each row, starting with the indexed row name (e.g. ID(default))
; A sections is formated with first a 64-bit representation of the ID as big endiannes, to optimize searching in the lower range, 
; subsequently not loosing significant effiecency in higher ranges.
; For each part of data written in a row section, the file-position is returned and written in the index-file.
