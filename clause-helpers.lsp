; Read a clause as presented after WHERE in an SQL Statement into a List-representation, that can be evaluated using EVAL etc.
; Should effectively also read all other types of clauses, and handles common operators, including NOT -> ID NOT 10
; Currently doesn't support math, appart from what could maybe be evaluated in 3 elements (2 + 2)
; Equally A func B could be used to call a function FUNC with parameters A and B. LIKE is thought to be implemented like this :: (ID LIKE 'a%') -> SEARCH
