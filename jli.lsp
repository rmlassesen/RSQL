; JLI DataType brainstorm 
; Binary representation of an array: [length][reference][reference][...]
; [length] 		Number of references, total length in bytes
; [reference] 	32-bit unsigned integer
; [integer]		64-bit signed
; [string]		[length] Total bytes for string	
;				[UTF-8] encoded charseq
; [hash-table]	[length][KEY]/[VALUE]
; [key]			[string] representation of key
; [value] 		2 bits giving the four possible values 0, 1, 2, 3, 22 bits for the length
;				0 for another [array], 1 for [hash-table], 2 for [string], 3 for [integer]

; Get length of array for number of references
; Loop across JLI array
; For each element, return file-position to indexing array
; Arrays are created recursively - so indexing-array should not be part of root function
