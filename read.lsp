; Read table overview
; Section 1: 1 byte containing the number of rows, and then row names as a string of 8-bit chars
; Row names are additionally prefaced with an integer containing an integer containing the length of the name
; And then ends with the datatype enumeration for that row
; Section 2: Number of indexes(1 byte) then row names as 8-bit chars, that is used as indexes. Default is id.
; These row-names are similarly prefaced with an integer containing the length of the name, but not the datatype

; Read the indexing file to determine the number of files and rows used for a specific table.

;			 (allowing files up to 4MB).
