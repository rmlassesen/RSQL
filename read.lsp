; Data-stream  is opened as an 8-bit stream
; Following function definitions are for reading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit values from the stream
; Subsequently a function to read a sequence of chars as 8- and 16-bit from the stream

; Read table overview
; Section 1: Row names in string as 8-bit chars
; Row names are similarly prefaced with an integer containing the size/length of the name
; Section 2: Row names as 8-bit chars, that is used as indexes. Default is id.
; Section 3: Single 8-bit integer, no delimiter, identifies data-type of each row
; Each section is prefaced with an integer containing the size of the section
